As a yoga practitioner, Shriram was one that always preferred sticking to traditional and authentic style of practice. However, when an opportunity to practice and eventually learn acroyoga presented itself to him, he was amazed at how much presence of mind and awareness it builds.

Acroyoga looks beautiful and is equally challenging to perform while providing a wide range of therapeutic benefits.

Through his practice, he realized how it enhances concentration, and helps in finding and developing incredible core strength as one challenges gravity with the poses. It also brings about a sense of surrender that is a must to fly and helps build a sense of connect within oneself and the partner.

Join Shriram in exploring this wonderful and exciting artform.

Fun Acroyoga fact : The first ever Acroyoga documentation is Tirumalai krishnamacharya performing asanas with a young student of his.
