Sound meditation stimulates our brain waves to induce deep relaxation, effortlessly. It is an excellent way for beginners to experience inner peace and calm.

While meditating, it’s usually difficult for us to sit motionlessly and focus. Our mind is a stranger to stillness and continuously needs something to do, even if it’s just listening to simple instructions. Guided meditations have helped us get over this challenge and now Sound Meditation takes it to the next level as it effortlessly takes us deep into a meditative state, which is otherwise very difficult to achieve unless we are a seasoned meditator.

### WHAT IS SOUND MEDITATION

> “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.” -- Nicolas Tesla

Sound meditation is an ancient healing practice that uses sounds and vibrations to induce deep meditative states. For thousands of years, sound has been used in ancient cultures to ease anxiety and promote a sense of well being. Many cultures, religions and mystic traditions have celebrated the power of music to induce trance and meditative states to expand one’s consciousness.  Sufi mysticism, Kirtan, gospel singing— even the use of bells and harps at a cathedral.

Sound Healing experts state that sound meditation not only affects a great deal of physical healing but also has far-reaching implications that occur on emotional and spiritual levels. The most popular way to practice sound meditation is through “sound baths,” which uses Tibetan singing bowls, quartz bowls, and bells to guide the listener.

### SOUND MEDITATION AND BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS

Singing Bowls are used for stimulating brain waves. Brain waves are patterns of electrical activity occurring in the brain. They are crucial to all aspects of brain functioning: thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. The pattern of brain waves changes depending on our level of consciousness and cognitive processing. For example, when we feel tired, slower brain waves dominate.
Sound meditation using Singing Bowls works on a scientific concept of Brain Entrainment, which states that listening to certain frequencies can change our brainwave states. The rich blend of harmonic overtones produced from the singing bowls helps us to first sink into the alpha state, then the mind lingers between alpha, theta and delta brain waves enabling deep relaxation and heightened perception.

### ADVANTAGES OF SOUND MEDITATION

Sound meditation has numerous advantages. The more prominent advantages are:

1. Achieve deep sleep in less time. 1 hour of sound bath can be equivalent to 4 hours of deep sleep.
2. Explore your creative intelligence. Sound meditation allows you to reach deep meditative state of Theta-brainwaves, where you can achieve high levels of creative visualization.
3. Increased learning capacity and performance. Regular sessions with sound meditation have shown significant increase in overall productivity and performance (this otherwise only occurs after several years of meditation)
4. Enhanced physical recovery. Sound bath research results showed that it has a significant impact on lactic acid reduction in athletes post-workout, accelerating recovery speed and enhancing mobility.

Sound meditation allows you to experience the rewards of peaceful rest by relieving your mind from distractions and your body from tension, taking you to an inner journey. You can now experience sound meditation on the Dozee App and enjoy the immense benefits associated.
